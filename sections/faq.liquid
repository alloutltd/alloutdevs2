If you are not available at the time of delivery then there are various situations that could occur, depending on the courier delivering your order.<br>
If a signature is needed upon delivery, then it is likely that the courier will try to re-deliver at another time.<br>
If no signature is necessary, the courier may leave you a calling card stating the location of your parcel. This could be left with a neighbour, in your provided safe place or with the courier where you may have to collect it from.<br>
Upon placing the order, we give you the opportunity to tell us where you would like the parcel to be left for if such events occur. If this is left unanswered, then it is the courier's decision to decide what happens with your parcel.</p>

Currently, we do not allow you to decide when to have your order delivered. Which is why it is important that you take a note of your estimated delivery date and track your parcel, so that you know when to expect it.<br>
However, giving you the opportunity to decide when you shall receive your order is something that we are looking into making an option for you in the near future.</p>

                        The parcel was refused upon delivery<br>
                        There was no clear route of access for the courier at the delivery address<br>
                        The delivery address was not clear for the courier<br>
                        The parcel was damaged during transit<br>
                        The order was not collected after failed delivery within the alotted timeframe<br>      
                        In the event of this occuring, we will send you an email upon receiving your order to inform you of what has happened. In this event, we will refund you the full amount for the items in your order. If you would still like the items in your order, then please place a new order for the times (please be aware that items may go out of stock within the period).</p>
